# ðŸŒ± CalmMind - Mental Health Analysis Platform

CalmMind is an intelligent mental health analysis platform that uses AI to understand emotions and provide personalized mental health care recommendations.

## Overview

CalmMind allows users to share their emotions and thoughts through a friendly web interface. The system will:

- **Detect language** and automatically translate to English if needed
- **Classify mental health conditions** using a trained BERT model
- **Provide personalized suggestions** based on AI analysis
- **Beautiful interface** with user-friendly and intuitive design

## System Architecture

The project is divided into 3 main components:

```
CalmMind/
â”œâ”€â”€ client/          # Frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
â”œâ”€â”€ api/          # Backend API (FastAPI)
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt # Python dependencies
â””â”€â”€ mental-health.ipynb  # ML Model (BERT Classification)
```

### Frontend (Client)
- Pure **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**
- Responsive and user-friendly interface
- Integration with backend API
- Visual display of analysis results

### Backend (Server)
- **FastAPI** framework
- `/analyze` API endpoint for processing requests
- Integration with ML model via Gradio
- Multi-language translation
- Generate suggestions using Groq LLM

## Machine Learning Model

### Dataset
- Uses "Sentiment Analysis for Mental Health" dataset
- Dataset link: `https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/suchintikasarkar/sentiment-analysis-for-mental-health`
- Includes labeled psychological state statements
- Preprocessed and cleaned data

### Model
- **BERT-base-uncased** as backbone
- Fine-tuned for classification task
- Handles class imbalance with weighted loss
- Deployed on Hugging Face Hub: `BienKieu/mental-health`

### Training Process
```python
# See details in mental-health.ipynb
- Text preprocessing and cleaning
- Tokenization with BERT tokenizer
- Training with custom loss function
- Evaluation and visualization
- Push model to Hugging Face Hub
```

### Fine-tuning on Imbalanced Data (7 labels)

- Problem: Class imbalance across 7 labels: `Anxiety`, `Bipolar`, `Depression`, `Normal`, `Personality disorder`, `Stress`, `Suicidal`.
- Technique: Weighted Cross-Entropy Loss to penalize minority classes more heavily.
- Split: Train/Test = 80/20.
- Backbone: `bert-base-uncased`, fine-tuned with class weights computed from label frequencies.
- Training notebook (Kaggle): `https://www.kaggle.com/code/battboii/mental-health`

### Result (Test 20%)

Evaluation results on the test set (confusion matrix / precision-recall-f1 per class):

```

## Installation and Setup

### System Requirements
- Python 3.11+
- Node.js (for frontend)
- GPU (recommended for model training)

### 1. Clone repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/BienKieu1411/CalmMind
cd CalmMind
```

### 2. Install Backend
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Install Frontend
```bash
cd client
# Open index.html in browser
# Or use live server
python -m http.server 7860
```

api/
â”œâ”€â”€ app.py         # FastAPI application
â””â”€â”€ run.py         # Server runner

mental-health.ipynb # ML model training notebook

requirements.txt # Python dependencies

vercel.json # Set up vercel 
```

### Adding New Features
1. **Frontend**: Edit `client/script.js` and `client/styles.css`
2. **Backend**: Add endpoints in `api/app.py`
3. **ML Model**: Update notebook and retrain model

## Performance

- **Backend**: FastAPI with async/await
- **ML Inference**: Gradio client with caching
- **Translation**: LibreTranslate API with timeout
- **LLM**: Groq API with optimized parameters

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Backend server is not running"**
   - Check if server is running on port 8000
   - View logs in terminal

2. **"Analysis failed"**
   - Check API keys in .env file
   - View network tab in DevTools

3. **Model not loading**
   - Check internet connection
   - Verify Hugging Face token
